Originally a concept from a team of developers, who wanted to crteate a task manager application for the every day user, however, after some financial and 
time consuming issues the idea was shelved and the team disbanded.

Plans were drafted and originally I was given prototypes of the application and designed their website as part of their marketing campaign, which is available at :

Having already completed a lot of User Research and User Testing for this project and being qualiufied with a First Class BSc. in Web Design and Web Development, I 
wanted to expand on my knowledge of using Vue.JS to crteate the same application under my own designs and project management plannning.

Please feel free to clone this repo, add some suggestions because after alkl that is what this is all about and knowledge is power at the end of the day.

Please enjoy and thank you
